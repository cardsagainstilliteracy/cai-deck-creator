# cai-deck-creator

A tool that assists you in creating CAI decks.

## Overview

The workflow for creating any CAI deck is more or less the same:

1. Type in the pinyin (without tones) into Google Translate.
2. Copy the Chinese characters and paste them into your JS file.
3. Paste the Chinese characters into the Google Translate source textbox.
4. Copy and paste the pinyin with tones into your JS file.
5. Copy the English translation and paste it into your JS file.
6. Repeat for each vocabulary term.

This tools automates the process. Now all you have to do is type in the pinyin (without tones), and it will generate the Chinese characters, English translation, and pinyin with tones for you.
